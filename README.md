# BrighamFibonacciSeq

Write a program to calculate the Nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence. If you use console 32 or console 64 the correct number must be place in the EAX register before you move 0 into EAX to return from the procedure. The N to select which number in the sequence to calculate must be declared in the data segment for console 32 and console 64 applications.
